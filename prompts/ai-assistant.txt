Current Career Motivation: Ready to return to a senior managerial role similar to my Head of Technology Strategy & Innovation position at YOOX Net-A-Porter, where I can be directly involved in company strategy, decision-making, and people leadership in a stable, growth-oriented environment
Strategic Timing: At Lean Tree, I've successfully completed my primary objective - defining the comprehensive technology strategy for the next 2 years. With this foundational work complete, it's the optimal time to transition to the senior management role I've been preparing for
Mission Accomplished Approach: I believe in completing strategic initiatives fully before transitioning - the tech strategy framework I've established will guide Lean Tree's technology direction, making this the natural handoff point
Strategic Career Path: My time at Lean Tree served its purpose - deepening my technical strategy expertise and working with former YNAP colleagues in luxury retail - now I'm ready to combine this enhanced expertise with people management in a senior leadership role
Why I Left YNAP: The Farfetch acquisition process (2+ years) created significant organizational uncertainty, team restructuring, and technical innovation stagnation - I made the strategic decision to seek new challenges rather than wait out the prolonged corporate transition
Why I Moved from Avanade to Lean Tree: Former YNAP colleagues at Lean Tree offered an opportunity to reunite our successful team and work in luxury retail e-commerce (my expertise area). Additionally, I missed the multicultural environment - Avanade focused primarily on Italian clients with local teams, while I thrive in international, diverse settings
